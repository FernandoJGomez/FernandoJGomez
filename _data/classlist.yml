  description: This course is about the sedimentology and geochemistry of carbonate sedimentary system from a basin-scale perspective all the way down to the microbe-mineral interactions involved in carbonate minerals precipitation and the biogeochemical signatures that carbonate sediments preserve -

  news1: Understanding element cycling on our planet due to geological, chemical and biological processes. The biogeochemical cycles, over geological time, controlled by the interaction between the Geosphere and Biosphere and how these co-evolve and influence each other.
