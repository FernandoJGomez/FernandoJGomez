  description: This course is about the sedimentology and geochemistry of carbonate sedimentary system from a basin-scale perspective all the way down to the microbe-mineral interactions involved in carbonate minerals precipitation and the biogeochemical signatures that carbonate sediments preserve -

    display: Since worldwide Science and Research is funded by the government, and thus people's taxes, I strongly believe that text books should be free (and not owned by companies or these should be a lot cheaper), so that is why this will drive you to SciHub link, so you will decide if it is ok for you to download useful textbooks for this course or you prefer to buy them. Be aware that SciHub website changes periodically so find an updated version of it.
