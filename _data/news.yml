  headline: "We just submitted a PhD project for a new grad student to work on the sedimentology and geochemistry of Strobel lake, in Patagonia. Strobel lake is a basalt-hosted freshwater lake that we consider is a good Earth-based analogue environment for the Jezero crater lacustrine sedimentary deposits on Mars, where the Perseverance rover recently launched by NASA is going to land. Our plan is to study microbe-mineral interactions and biosignatures preservation in the Strobel Lake sedimentary deposits that may provide some insight to better understand Jezero crater sedimentary record. <br/>
