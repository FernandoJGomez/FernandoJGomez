- title: "Mineralized microbialites as archives of environmental evolution, Laguna Negra, Catamarca Province, Argentina"
  image: thumb-Geobio_cover.jpg
  description: In this paper, we examined isotopic and elemental signatures in carbonate microbialites a.k.a microbially-mediated rocks. The concentric bands inside the rock preserve a time-series of lake evolution. Much like tree rings, these laminations allow reconstruction of lake history through interpretation of paired isotopes of carbon, sedimentary organic matter, and trace metal content. Code for analysis and figures can be found on my Github.

- title: "Complex microbial communities drive iron and sulfur cycling in Arctic fjord sediments"
  image: network.jpg
  description: Iron and sulfur cycling in Van Keulenfjord, Svalbard, is mediated both by abiotic chemical reactions as well as microbial metabolisms and byproducts. In this paper, we examined microbial community composition by 16S rRNA gene analysis and sedimentary organic matter at high depth resolution of 1 cm down to ~20 cm at two sites. Ordination analysis and microbial networks suggests that as glaciers retreat, microbial communities will become less complex and sulfate reducers will potentially outcompete microorganisms that respire iron and manganese. Code for analysis and figures can be found on my Github.
