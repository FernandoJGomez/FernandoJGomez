- title: "Mineralized microbialites as archives of environmental evolution, Laguna Negra, Catamarca Province, Argentina"
  image: thumb-Geobio_cover.jpg
  description: In this paper, we examined isotopic and elemental signatures in carbonate microbialites a.k.a microbially-mediated rocks. The concentric bands inside the rock preserve a time-series of lake evolution. Much like tree rings, these laminations allow reconstruction of lake history through interpretation of paired isotopes of carbon, sedimentary organic matter, and trace metal content. Code for analysis and figures can be found on my Github.

#- title: "Interlaboratory Quantification of Bacteria and Archaea in Deeply Buried Sediments of the Baltic Sea (IODP Expedition 347)"
#  image: microscope.jpg
#  description: For many years following the first discovery of microbes in deeply-buried marine sediments, failure to find Archaea seemed like good evidence that the deep subsurface biosphere is a bacterial world. However, we hypothesized that this finding was a result of a methodological artifact that biases results toward bacteria. In this paper, we test this hypthosis. We found that instead, failure to identify Archaea rests with very high limits of detection for microscopy and suggested qPCR as a better method for quantification of biomass.

#- title: "Methanogens in the Antarctic Dry Valley Permafrost"
#  image: Methanogen.jpg
#  description: Methanogens generate the powerful greenhouse gas, methane. A large question with climate change is how thawing permafrost will affect the trajectory of methane dynamics -- will thawing lead to a positive feedback loop where more warming means more methane which means more warming? In this paper, we interrogated a methanogenic genome from Antarctica, the first ever recontructed from Antarctic permafrost. We found several different methane-generating pathways. Protein modeling highlights protein adaptations that allow this microbe to endure the harsh permafrost environment.

#  description: Data science has a lot to offer to the geoscience community. This paper reviewes the latest developments in mineral ecology using cutting edge visualization techniques, network analysis, and affinity algorithms. When applied to large, public data repositories, these techniques can highlight the emergent properties underlying multidimensional datasets and help make better scientific predictions.
