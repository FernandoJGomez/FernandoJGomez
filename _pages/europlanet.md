## Cold, extreme glacial and lacustrine environments of the Andes of Argentina Puna region: Dry-cold environments

The high-altitude Puna Plateau (4000-6000 meters a.s.l.) of Northwest Argentina (Salta, Jujuy and Catamarca
 provinces; 22-28º SL) is subject to a cold, arid climate. The area is characterized by hundreds of hypersaline
 lakes, glaciers, rock glaciers, hydrothermal systems, and environmental extremes with high-UV influx, low
 water activity, extreme daily temperature fluctuations (> 40ºC), strong winds (gravel dunes due to winds up to
 400 km/h, Puruya and Carachi Pampa areas), and a volcanic-dominated geological settings. All these features
 make the region ideal as a planetary analogue for Mars and other icy planets/moons environments. There are
 notable interactions between hydrothermal systems, hypersaline lakes and glaciers, both ice and rock. Given the
 extreme environments, when present life is typically microbial. Locally preserved stromatolites also record
 evidence of life forms under past climate conditions.
 
**The Laguna Negra lake**: Located at the southeast end of the Laguna Verde Complex (LVC), in the
southernmost Puna, the Laguna Negra is a shallow (2 m deep) hypersaline lake (8.63 km2). It comprises a
 CaCl2-rich brine, with compositions in the main lake and groundwater springs fluctuating between pH of ~ 5.7
 and ~ 8 and a salinity between ~ 320 and ~ 9 ppt respectively. The mixing zone between the main lake and
 groundwater is where most microbial carbonate precipitation takes place (calcite & aragonite). Our published
 research in the area has characterized the Sedimentology, Biogeochemistry and Geomicrobiology (Gomez at al.
 2018).

**The high-altitude cryosphere**: The high-altitude, cold and arid conditions mean permafrost glacial conditions
 prevail. The glaciers have characteristics that make them of particular interest for as planetary analogues. They
 are small (typically ˃1 km2), situated far above the 0ºC isotherm altitude, and have limited flow, and the annual
 mass balance is similar across the whole area of the glacier (not altitude-dependent). Active rock glaciers
 represent the most widespread features of the permafrost environment and are found above 4500 m a.s.l.
 Analogous features has been recorded on Mars and monitoring the superficial flow and climatic conditions of
 three rock glaciers in Northwest Argentina is on-going.


## Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego region: Wet-cold environments

The Patagonia region records glacial activity since the late Miocene (c. 7 My). Today, the Southern Patagonia
 Ice field (48-52º SL) is the largest extra polar ice mass (13,000 km2) in the Southern Hemisphere (40-60 km
 wide and 120 km long). Numerous temperate outlet glaciers flow from the ice field and terminate on land, sea
 or lakes. Glaciers on the windward site are feed by high precipitation from Southern Westerlies. Precipitation
 decreases sharply on the eastern side of the Andes generating arid condition in the Patagonian steppe where
 numerous small endorreic lakes develop. These lakes record microbial life and its mineralized record
 (stromatolites) in a environmental setting different to the Puna area. The last 16,000 yr of Patagonian glacier
 history (post Last Glacial Maximum deglaciation) is being characterized for world-wide correlation. To
 understand the present glacier behavior, we are measuring The mass balance of the Martial Glacier has been
 monitored since 2000 along with two rock glaciers in the Cordillera Fueguina.
CITERRA staff have a long experience in conducting field campaigns in collaborative research projects with international colleagues from
 both academic, agency (e.g., NASA) and industry, e.g. > 15 visits from the oil company Petrobras. There were
 28 academic visitors in last 3 years of which 19 were international. The facility will be managed by Dr. Fernando Gomez assisted by Dr. Mateo Martini with administrative and practical support for TA visitors provided by the University of Cordoba.
