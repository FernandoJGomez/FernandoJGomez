![]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/teampic/Fer_rounded_pic.png){: style="width: 25%; float: right; border: 5px"}  I am a researcher at the [CICTERRA, Centro de Investigaciones en Ciencias de la Tierra](http://cicterra.conicet.unc.edu.ar/en/) and a professor at the Geology Department in the [Universidad Nacional de Cordoba](https://www.unc.edu.ar/english/). During 2019 and 2020 I was a visiting professor in Sedimentology/Stratigraphy and Biogeochemistry at the [Earth and Planetary Sciences Department, Washington University (Saint Louis, USA)](https://eps.wustl.edu/).

I am just a member of a **multidisciplinary group of people** that include geologists, paleontologists, microbiologists, chemists/geochemists and geophysicists with some common goals and interests, that over the years have been collaborating (formally or informally and in different ways) to answer some specific scientific questions that can be included in the broad field of **Geobiology**. These collaborations were essential to be able to accomplish some of our research goals, mostly given the scarcity of funding and resources that sometimes we face while doing science in Argentina. So, **what is shown in this website is of course the work of all these people** that I was lucky to meet, work and interact with, of course I deeply appreciate the funding from the [CONICET](https://www.conicet.gov.ar/), the [MINCYT](https://www.argentina.gob.ar/ciencia) and the [SECYT](https://www.unc.edu.ar/ciencia-y-tecnolog%C3%ADa/subsidios-secyt).
This people include: **Cecilia Mlewski**, **Flavia Boidi**, **Ariadna Coppa Vigliocco**, **Agustin Mors**, **Ricardo Astini**, **Mateo Martini**, **Eliana Soto Rueda**, **Laura Borgnino**, **Marcelo Carreras**, **Mara Matic** (all CICTERRA members), **Nicole Pietrasiak** (New Mexico State University), **Alex Bradley**, **David Fike**, **Scott Beeler**, **Jenn Houghton** (Washington University, Saint Louis, USA), **Linda Kah**, **Rob Riding** (Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, University of Tennessee, USA), **Miles Henderson** (University of Texas, Permian Basin, Odessa-USA), **Joy Buongiorno** (Maryville College, Tennesse, USA), **Emmanuelle Gérard**, **Benedicte Ménez**, **Celine Pisapia**, (IPGP-Paris, France), **Karim Benzerara** (CNRS-Paris France), **M.E. Farías**, **Patricio Villafañe**, **Agustina Lencina** (LIMLA, CONICET, Tucumán), **Rogerio Schiffer**, **Lisie Falcão**, **Bárbara Teixeira** (PETROBRAS) as well as other people from **CENPES, PETROBRAS**, among many many others.

My research focus on several aspects including **basin-scale studies of carbonate and mixed sedimentary systems** (stratigraphy and sedimentology) as well as the **biogeochemistry** and **geomicrobiology** of carbonate precipitation. As a member of a multidisciplinary research group our goal is to **understand physico-chemical and biological processes involved in carbonate precipitation**, and how we can use this information to better understand the complex interactions between the **Geosphere** and the **Biosphere**, and how these interactions are preserved in the sedimentary record. Understanding **microbe-mineral interactions** and **biogeochemical cycling** of biologically significant elements (C, O, N, S, P, trace elements) and how this information is preserved in sedimentary carbonates is extremely important to define **biosignatures** (signals of biological activity). This allow us to track the **evolution of the biosphere** and its impact on the environment. Thus, our research is also focused on **Astrobiology** where we use modern and ancient environments to study the evidences of life (mostly microbial) in the sedimentary record on Earth, and this can help in the search of active or fossil life in preserved in the sedimentary record in other planets such as **Mars**.

We work on modern and ancient environments and our focus is **carbonate sedimentology**, **biogeochemistry** and **geomicrobiology** under a diverse set of environmental conditions, to unravel the physical, chemical and biological controls. This includes **hypsersaline** and **freshwater lakes**, **marine carbonates** as well as **hot springs** and **fluvial carbonates** deposits (**siliceous sinters**, **tufa** and **travertines**).

### Research areas

Since we want to cover a wide spectrum of environmental conditions where carbonate precipitation takes place, these are the selected research areas:

**High-altitude hypersaline lakes**<br>

The **Laguna Negra** is a **high-altitude hypersaline** lake where the **extreme environmental conditions** there recorded (low water activity, high UV-radiation influx, extreme daily temperature changes, etc) are similar to those typically interpreted for some ancient sedimentary environments in the **Early Earth** (for example the Archean Meentheena Member, Tumbiana Formation in the Fortescue Group, Western Australia) as well as other planets such as **Mars** (sedimentary deposits at the **Jezero** and **Gale Craters**). In the Laguna Negra we can observe a spectrum of conditions for carbonate mineral precipitation, from **completely abiotic** to **biologically influenced**. This results in the development of a wide carbonate belt represented by carbonate **stromatolites** and **oncoids** deposits as well as **abiotic laminar crusts**, that allow us to investigate microbial and physico-chemical controls on carbonate precipitation and the preservation of biosignatures. Over the years we have been actively working in this unusual site with different approaches and several colleagues such as **Cecilia Mlewski** (CICTERRA), **Mara Matic** (CICTERRA), **Alexandra Rodler** (University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences, Vienn) **Emmanuelle Gerard** and her group at IPGP (Paris, France), **Flavia Boidi** (CICTERRA), **Joy Buongiorno** (Maryville College, TN, USA), **Linda C. Kah** (University of Tennessee, TN, USA), **Julie Barltey** (University of Minnesota, USA), **Scott Beeler**, **Alex Bradley** and **David Fike** (Washington University, Saint Louis, USA). In addition, I have been invited to collaborate with **Maria Eugenia Farías** (CONICET), **Patricio Villafañe** (CONICET) and **Agustina Lencina** (CONICET) in the study similar sites in the area, including interesting oncoids and microbialites at **Pozo Bravo** y **Las Quinoas** (Catamarca, Province).

Some **recent papers** of our research include (see details about full references in my CV section) Gomez et al (2014, 2018, 2020), Beeler et al (2020), Buongiorno et al (2019), Mlewski et al. (2018), Shalygyn et al. (2019), Boidi et al., (2020); Lencina et al., in prep. Villafañe et al., in press.

**Hot springs, tufas and travertines lakes**<br>

**Hot springs** are interesting site from a geomicrobiological and astrobiological perspective since these are sites typically colinized by complex microbial communities where rapid mieneralization takes place. For this reason these have been a target in the exploration of **Mars**, where sedimentary deposits related to hot springs have been recorded (for example in the **Columbia Hills**, **Gusev crater**). For this reason we selected several **high-altitude hot springs** in the Catamarca Province (for example **Termas Los Hornos**) to better understand an environment where mineral precipitation is typically controlled by physical-chemical processes such as **carbon dioxide degassing** and **temperature changes** and where **silica** and **carbonate precipitation** are common. This provides an excellent place to test biosignatures preservation. Here, together with **Agustin Mors** (CICTERRA), **Anabel Piersigilli** (Universidad Nacional de Córdoba), and **Ricardo Astini** (CICTERRA) as well as external colleagues such as **Frank Corsetti** and his group (University of Southern California) we try to understand the main controls in **facies** and **microtextures** of these sedimentary deposits and the **biogeochemical signatures** these deposits may preserve. For example, recently we have focused on two specific **spheroidal particles**: **pisolites** and **spherulites** formed by the same fluid chemistry, but under different environmental conditions. The Los Hornos pisolites were formed under agitated waters devoid of significan biological influence and the spherulites were formed under calm, low-energy conditions, colonized by a diverse microbial biosphere (including abundant cyanobacteria and diatoms). These carbonate particles show remarkable textural and geochemical differences that we are exploring to better understand biotic and abiotic signatures and **biosignautres modifications** during **early diagenesis** in these continental settings.

Some **recent papers** about this research (see details about full references in my CV section) include Astini et al., (2018); Mors et al., (2019); Piersigilli et al., (2020); Mors et al., submitted.

**Basalt hosted lakes as Martian analogues**<br>

In the search for **Earth-based sedimentary environments** analogues for those recorded on **Mars**, we staterd working in the **Strobel Lake** in the Patagoni of Argentina. The Strobel lake is a **fresh-water lake** developed on a **basaltic bedrock** and a semi-arid climate, where a suite of sedimentary environments and related sedimentary deposits include **shallow** to **deep lacustrine deposits**, **fluvial** to **delta deposits**, and an extensive **carbonate belt** where abundant fossil and active **microbialites** (**stromatolites** and **thrombolites**) have been recorded. Our goal here, together with **Cecilia Mlewski** (microbiologist at CICTERRA) and **Emiliano Rivarola** (Geologist and PhD candidate at CICTERRA) is to study these deposits with an **astrobiological perspective** integrating **multispectral image analysis**, **sedimentology**, **biogeochemistry** and **geomicrobiology**. This site is interesting since fluid-rock interaction, weathering processes, authigenic mineral precipitation and associated geomicrobiological and biogeochemical processes must be similar (in some aspects) to those that could be observed or recorded on Mars surface. Particularly, since recently **NASA** has launched a probe (**Perseverance**, landing in february 2021) to explore the **lacustrine** and **delta** deposits of **Jezero Crater**, where also abundant carbonate sedimentary units have been recorded. This makes the Strobel lake a **fascinating planetary analogue for Jezero Crater**.

**Creataceous lacustrine, marine-marginal carbonates**<br>

An interesting carbonate and mixed sedimentary system of Cretaceous age is recorded in the **Yacoraite Formation**, preserved in thew stratigraphy of the **Creataceous** basins of Salta and Jujuy provinces, in Northwestern Argentina. This site is **interesting for several reasons**: **1)** it is still debated if these deposits are **lacustrine** or **completely marine** and if thus these may represent important **sea-level fluctuations** recorded inland after the Pangea break-up. **2)** These deposits have an interesting record of a diverse (meter-scale) suite of **microbialites (stromatolites)** and associated **ooids-rich calcarenites** arranged in meter-scale cycles. These calcarenites host some beatifully preserved **ooids**, formed under different environmental conditions and that allow studing the different environmental settings for **ooids formation** and **their diagenetic transformations**. **3)** The Yacoraite Formation **record the K-T boundary** which still is cryptic in this area and in most of this basin. **4)** The Yacoiraite Formation has been used as an **exposed sedimentary analogue** for the unusual carbonates that host the **world-class oil reserves** known as the the **Pre-Salt**, located in the **off-shore basins of Brazil** and on the **Africa** coast. **Ariadna Coppa Vigliocco** (CICTERRA) is a grad student currently working with myself and **Ricardo Astini** (CICTERRA) on the **stratigraphic correlation** and **environmental intepretation** of this interesting unit. In addition she is working on a detailed analysis of **ooids morphogenesis**, **microtextures** and the **geochemical signatures** to unravel primary formation processes and diagenetic alterations.

Some **recent papers** about this research (see details about full references in my CV section) include Astini et al., (2020), Coppa Vigliocco et al., submitted.

**The Cambro-Ordovician Precordillera carbonate platform and the Triassic rift related carbonates and siliciclastics**<br>

During my PhD I focused on understanding the evolution of the **lower Paleozoic Precordillera carbonate platform** (San Juan Province, Argentina). The Precordillera represents a **microterrane** detached from the **Laurentia** margin in the **early Cambrian** and after rifting and drifting stages it was accreted to the western margin of **Gondwana** in the **Mid-Upper Ordovician**. Its 2500 m of sedimentary rocks thickness record this geotectonic evolution as well as the evolution of the  biosphere, oceans/atmosphere and sedimentary environments. Our work there has been understanding the Precordillera stratigraphy and sedimentology, improving correlation between different sections using different approaches including chemostratigraphy and dating techniques. In addition, together with **Ricardo Astini** and **Marcelo Carrera** (both at CICETRRA) we have studied **microbial** as well as **metazoan reefs** preserved in the different sedimentary units. Recently, working with **Miles Henderson** and **Linda Kah**, we fosued on understanding the **carbon** and **sulfur biogeochemical cycles**, in order to improve the current models, combinig **chemostratigraphy** and **numerical modeling** techniques (box models).
In addition to the Lower Paleozoic deposits together with **Ricardo Astini** (CICTERRA) and **Bárbara Teixeira** (PETROBRAS) we worked on some interesting **Triassic deposits** in the Precordillera, related to the generalized Triassic extension that characterized the northwestern or Argentina. We applied a **source-to-sink approach** to understand **sediment provenance** and **basin infill** as well as **paleoclimatic evolution** of these mixed carbonate-siliciclastic rift-related depotis.

Some **recent papers** about this research (see details about full references in my CV section) include Gomez and Astini (2005, 2006, 2015), Gomez et al., (2007), Carrera et al., (2017); and Teixeira et al., (2018).

**Understanding the pre-Salt reservoirs and their unusual carbonates**<br>

Over about 5 yeas, together with **Dr. Ricardo Astini** we have been collaborating as consultants with colleagues at the **CENPES** (Petrobras, Rí
o de Janeiro) looking at the pretty **unusual sedimentary carbonates of the Pre-Salt**, in the off-shore basins of Brazil (Campos, Santos, etc). This research motivated some our our project to understand better microbial carbonates formed under different conditions (hots springs, hypersaline and freshwater lakes and marine environments) in the search for **good analogues for the Creatceous carbonates** typically observed in the Brazilian basins and that host some of the biggest oil reseraves in the world.

Although most of our work wiht Petrobras was under a confidentiality agreement, some **work in preparation** about this research was authorized and will be ready to be published soon and this include some work we have done with **Lissie Falçao** and **Rogerio Schiffer** at CENPES, where we did some comparative analysis between Quaternary travertines in San Juan (Argenmtina) and some drill core of the pre-Salt carbonates that we interpreted as travertine deposits.

**Machine learning approach applied to carbonate geochemistry**<br>

**Data science** (classic **Statistics** as well as **Machine** and **Deep Learning**) has changed the way we do science, giving us the chance to deal with abundant and **multidimensional information**. Our work, because of the multidisciplinary nature of our approach, by integrating **microbial diversity data** (for example **metagenomics**), **geochemical**, **mineralogical** and **textural** data, produce a huge amount of information that can be challenging to use and intepret. **Machine learning** and **Deep learning** techniques allow us to find **patterns in data** in order to extract useful information for our purposes. For this reeason we are applying this approach to extract information from the different research sites we have been working on, particularly the Laguna Negra and Terma Los Hornos in order to explore the use of these techniques to extract **biosignatures** from geochemical and microbial diversity data, and preservation or alteration of these biosignatures.
