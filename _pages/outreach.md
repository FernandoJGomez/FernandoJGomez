# “Learning is never cumulative, it is a movement of knowing which has no beginning and no end.” (Bruce Lee)

# “Empty your mind. Be formless, shapeless, like water. If you put water into a cup, it becomes the cup. You put water into a bottle and it becomes the bottle. You put it in a teapot, it becomes the teapot. Now, water can flow or it can crash. Be water, my friend.” (Bruce Lee)
