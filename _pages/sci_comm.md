In recent years, the proliferation of anti-science rhetoric has increased substaintally. The spread of misinformation and distrust of scientific sources not only poses a great danger to our health and our environment, but it also diminishes our standing globally. This leaves us with the question:</p><br>  
<p style="font-size:130%;"> <b>how do we stop false narratives about science?</b></p><br>
<p align= "justify">
The answer is simple, yet incredibly difficult: improve science communication. Unfortunately,
past generations of scientists who have adopted the “guru on a hill” personality helped cultivate the
widespread misrepresentation of science. Out of this elitist mentality, anti-science rhetoric was borne.
Now, the onus falls on us to combat attacks on science and scientists with approachable narratives,
simple explanations, relatable content, and inclusivity. More and more scientists are stepping up to take
on the challenge of reshaping the way they communicate science to friends and neighbors. I joined
many of these scientists for a one and a half day bootcamp on science communication.

# Day 1: Best practices in communication

 
A first crucial step to effective communication is to recognize the curse of knowledge. We know what we
know, they do not. To avoid estranging your audience, understand who they are and what they care
about. Prepare a memorable narrative and find common ground while effectively delivering the big
picture.

Next, perfect your “why”. This is the
significance/relevance of our work. Often, scientist focus on the “how”, skipping the “why” altogether.
But this is a huge mistake!! Your audience cares about the significance of your work and the relevance
to their lives. The significance of scientific research is especially important to those aiming to keep their
names off of the pages of the infamous [Wastebook]
(http://www.sciencemag.org/careers/2017/06/congress-says-your-work-wasteful-now-what).<br>

Luckily, there is a formula to help craft an elegant and easily digestible
significance statement. Start with a big idea that is concise. This serves as the framework for your argument. Next, develop three key messages that support your big idea. These can be facts, statistics, or predictions based on data. Think of transition statements that allow you to flow from each key message seamlessly. This is the one I drummed up during the course: <br>

We need to improve our understanding of the feedbacks between the planet and microbial
communities, and continued government funding of fundamental research on environmental
microorgansisms will help us achieve that aim. Microorganisms in the environment have powerful
impacts on other living things around them as well as the atmosphere, including the air we breathe.
Microorganisms in the environment produce natural products, like antibiotics and enzymes, that help
them make a living in their ecosystem. But, we can use those natural products to save lives in the case
of antibiotics, or we can make them into lucrative consumer products. For example, we’ve discovered
soil microorganisms with diverse natural products that do can practically everything, ranging from
helping us wash our clothes in cold water, to developing new molecular tools that people like me use
all the time in the lab. However, not all microbial products are good for us. Microorganisms also
produce atmospheric greenhouse gasses, such as methane and carbon dioxide. Most of the world’s
microorganisms are found in marine systems, and although they are tiny, they have the potential to
make big changes to our planet. By studying what microorganisms in marine systems are producing,
we can model future changes in the atmosphere. This can tell us what to expect and help us make
informed policy decisions.<br>

# Day 1: Debunking myths and defending uncertainty

As scientists, we are a valuable resource for both providing new, exciting information and debunking
widely repeated myths. On day 2 of the bootcamp, we learned how to properly address myths,
enlighten the audience, and dispel misinformation. First, don’t start with the myth, this reinforces it.
Instead, make a “myth sandwich”: present facts before and after the myth. Next, validate their concerns
by sharing what you do know about the myth, but then debunk the misinformation. Finally, always
emphasize what you do know. The same tactics should be used when discussing scientific uncertainty.
Be transparent about what do and do not know, and emphasize what we do know. But, remember, you
cannot change everyone’s mind...<br>

Finally, some general tips to always keep in mind when communicating science:

- Avoid dual-use words like theory, statistically significant, and average.
- Be consistent. Use jargon or terminology sparingly (eg. CRISPR shoudl be 'gene editing').
- Be thoughtful and strategic about what you present.
- Be conversational. Aim for about 150 words per minute, vary your pace, pause.
- Do not lecture or patronize.
- Body language goes a long way: maintain eye contact, don’t flail around, and don’t fidget with
keys/coins in your pocket.
- Provide a multi-media experience with graphs and images alongside your data.
- Practice, but not so much that you sound canned.
